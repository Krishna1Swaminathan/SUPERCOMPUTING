So after you are in the SUPERCOMPUTING folder. 

mkdir assignments (this creates the assignemnts folder)
mkdir assignment_01...08 (created the folders for assignments 1-8 submission)
inside assinment 1
touch README.md (creates the readme file)\
touch assignment_1_essay.md (creates the file i will put my essay in)

nano assignment_1_essay.md (I used nano to write the essay in though i found it easier to write it in a google doc and then paste it over)
nano README.md (this is where i am writing all the commands I used)

command x to exit nano
